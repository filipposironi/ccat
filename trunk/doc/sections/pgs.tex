\section{PlanetaryGearSet Class}
\label{Section:PlanetaryGearSet}
The \emph{PlanetaryGearSet} class is formalized thanks to the code reported in Listing~\ref{Code:PlanetaryGearSet}.

The Planetary Gear Set guarantees that every time a gear shift event occurs the \texttt{actualGear} will be maintained until the shift is finished.

Inside this component are defined all axioms limiting gear shifts to effective ones only (e.g. it is impossibile to shift down a gear if \texttt{actualGear} is \texttt{First}.

Moreover, through the formalization of the Planetary Gear Set we impose that we can't receive a gear shift event if we are in the middle of a gear shift. Different gear shifting times are defined for different gears and different steps.

The gears \texttt{Drive}, \texttt{Park}, and \texttt{Reverse} can be selected if and only if the transmission shaft is decoupled from the engine.

The state of the Planetary Gear Set changes if and only if an event occurs.
