During the last phase of our modelling we decided not to formalize the \emph{Torque Converter} and this decision depends on the way the Torque Converter works.

The Torque Converter is a mechanical component that works coupling and decoupling the \emph{Transmission Shaft} and the \emph{Engine Shaft}. It solves is duty without the necessity to receive commands from any component of the system and this is the cause we have decided to remove it from our model.

Anyway, the state of the Torque Converter is really important for the system since it gives information that permits to insert or not to insert some gears and other details that aren't taken into account in this project.
